This is a Python script that checks the printer paper levels around the College of Computing, where I work. The uploaded version of the code has the actual website addresses removed (you would need to be connected to the department VPN to access them anyway). It also has my password, username, spreadsheet name, chromedriver location, and json key changed to generic names/directories.
